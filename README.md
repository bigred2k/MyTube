# MyTube

A tool to display latest videos from your favourite Youtube channels. I didn't like the 'Subscriptions' page much on YouTube so thought I'd build my own. I also don't want to be logged into YouTube all the time - this tool allows me not to be!

Runs mostly in the browser, storing data in local storage.
